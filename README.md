pdf2img
=======

pdf2img is an Atlassian Confluence macro which monitors a Confluence instance and for each pdf uploaded to the site
the macro creates an image thumbnail of that pdf on the same page it was attached to.

Unfortunately the project has stalled for the time being (university studies... :)), however, pdf2img was very near 
completion when I last left it. If I find myself with free time I will revisit this project and finish what I started :).

The macro utilizes the ImageMagick api to generate the image thumbnails from pdfs.
